nettest-ovl is a tesla overlay that tests your internet connection without contacting Nintendo's servers. Currently it does nothing. Eventually, I want this project to contain all of the same features as the built-in internet tester, with the added feature of defining custom domains and IP addresses, and not risking a ban in the process.

* WerWolf for their excellent Tesla-Template, libtesla library, and GBATemp tutorial
* Edizon/Tesla Discord, not for directly helping me, but having the small snipets of help that I needed
* nedex with QuickNTP, my original idea was heavily inspired by their work
* SegFault42 with sys-ftpd-ovl, their IP grabber code really helped me understand how to get it to work
